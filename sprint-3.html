        <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3> 
        <p>     
          My understanding of EQ or Emotional Intelligence is one of being aware and in control of your emotions and understanding when and why you are feeling certain ways in certain situations and then being able to capatalise on this and use it to your advantage or with helping others. 
            How is it different from IQ? IQ is tested by logical tests and measures peoples process in carry out certain tasks and perfoming in a test based format. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                   Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).
            </h3>
            <p>
                A control flow is the flow of which the code is read and understood in. Loops then tell a piece of that code to repeat it's command until it has reached the specific point in which it is commanded to stop.
                In an anology, Flow and Loops can be described like a factory working to make a certain number of cars by a specific date, the code is the factory workers making cars and the loop is telling them how many they need and when to stop.
            </p>
            <h3>
                   Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
            </h3>
            <p>
                The DOM is the coding interface that is standard in websites, it categorises HTML into Tree structures and allows changes and modifications from languages like JavaScript.
            </p>
            <h3>
                   Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
            </h3>
            <p>
                An array can store different data within one variable, and an object then adds ontop of arrays by allowing it different properties.
            </p>
            <h3>
                   Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Funcations can take and use one or more values and input them and return a result. They are helpful if the code has been reused a lot.
