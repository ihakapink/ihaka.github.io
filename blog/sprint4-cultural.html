    <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3> 
    <p>     
      Once you understand that your brain is mallable and you are able to shape and create new learning patterns in your brain, it opens the door to the further exploration of learning new skills and services after what we use to think was not possible.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit
        </h3>
        <p>
          You would want to understand the personal benefit of it, which would include better ways of learning and enhanced ways of understanding how your brain takes in information.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity
        </h3>
        <p>
           One of the ways, would be one of habit and practice, to help create new pathways in yor brain and the more you train and let these pathways become second nature you will become better at this task.

        <h3>
          Discuss what it is and why it is relevant
        </h3>
        <p>
            Growth mindset is one of challenging the notion of a "fixed mindset" and instead focusing more on how this isn't true and that you are able to change the way you think and grow mentally.
        </p>
        <h3>
          In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
        </h3>
          <p>
              Very, I thought your thought patterns and mentally abilities were set in stone!
          </p>
          <h3>
            How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
          </h3>
          <p>
             I will try new techniques that will broaden my ability when it comes to tackling problems with a mental aspect to them.

          <h3>
            Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.
          </h3>
          <p>
            On reflection, having a better understanding of what actually goes on in your head from a scientific standpoint and how you can shape these to your benefit. The biggest one that I will incorporate will be the positive reinforcement to myself rather than the doubting and negative voices that creep in when trying to attempt a challenge.
