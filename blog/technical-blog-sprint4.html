  <h3>
      Getting blocked with a Simple Problem.
  </h3>
  <p>
      The problem was I wasn't able to locate what was wrong with a part of the code I was working on and it kept coming up with an error!
  </p>
  <p>
      I first googled if anyone had had any similar problems, and then asked my peers.
  </p>
  <p>
      I felt a bit overwhelmed and very frustrated because I couldn't source the problem right away and I was trying to keep within a certain time frame.
  </p>
  <p>
      I learnt, NOT TO PANIC, and then take a deep breath, read over the code again and ask your peers first because they will be going through the same problems.

  </p>

  <h3>
      Solved a problem in an elegant way.
  </h3>
  <p>
      My blog wasn't appearing online and I had no idea why!
  </p>
  <p>
      I googled first trying to see why it wasn't online, I couldn't find any answers, then I asked my peers and they couldn't figure it out, then my tutor suggested an option, and I tried it and it didn't fully work, so I ended up fully moving my blog to another place on my computer, on the back of what my tutor said, and it worked!
  </p>
  <p>
    Very frustrated and like a failure because it was one of the first things that we were doing in the course.
  </p>
  <P>
      Again, to trust yourself and your ability and ask for help and that everyone is in the same boat at the beggining.
  </P>
