    <h1>What's the difference between margin, border and padding?</h1>
    <p>
      When creatng a website you want it too look and feel nice, this is where Css comes in too play. Css stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
      Css helps style up your webpage, but in doing so there are some elements that are used in this.
      These are the margin, border and padding. 
    </p>
    <p>
     The image below is call the box model and gives a visual representation of what this looks like. 
    </p>
    <div> 
        <img src="boxmodel.JPG" alt="the box model">
      </div>
    <p>
        And here is a brief overview of what each one does exactly: 
    </p>
<p> 
    Margin: The space that the margin occupy's is what is around the border and the padding. Anything that is not the space of padding or border will be margin.  
</p>

<p>
    Border: This space is what surrounds the border and the content inside it. 
</p>

<p>
    Padding: This is the space that is directly surrounding the content box, it covers all 4 sides of the content box.
