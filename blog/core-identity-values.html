       An ethical decsion I had to make was wheter or not to buy drinks for my mates that weren't 18. I ended up doing it, nothing came of it, but something could of happened to them, that could of affected their lives and mine for providing drinks to them.

      I am quarter Maori, but I wasn't brought up in this culture as much due to us moving away at a young age. Later on I have met more family that have been part of my heritage which gives me a better understanding of who my family is and where they came from.

      My Strengths would be that I don't like giving up on a project or problem that I am doing. I can be distracted with other things and have been known to procrastinate from time to time!

        Not giving up on a project or problem will come in handy when I face tougher problems that take a lot of time to solve. This will cause frustration and not liking what I am doing, but this will also motivate me to do better and push through these emotions and get the job done.

        At uni we were doing a group presentation, and one person hadn't done their bit or shown up to group meetings, even though they had said in previous communications that they would. Eventually they got their part of the presentation done after chatting to them about how it isn't just about them and it would affect all of us if they did not contibute.
