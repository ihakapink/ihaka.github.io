    <p>
     With the following above, I am dedicating 40 solid hours of work, with breaks in between to refresh and break up the days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within these parameters I have set out, I am wanting to be mindful of how much time I spend on one certain section, as the goal is to be able to complete tasks well but at pace. I want to be able to stick to my allocated goals and keep them within time.
    </p>
    <p>
      For seeking help, my first call will be back to the foundation notes and re-read them, then to the #foundations slack channel to see if anyone else has encountered the problem, then to google and lastly to my facilitator. I think learning how to solve problems on my own is one of my main goals for this course.
    </p>
    <p>
      My strenghts include my desire to understand problems and be not give up on a issue if I am may not undertstand it initally. My limitations are not asking for help and I can be stubborn in wanting to do things on my own to prove that I can, but this again can be a weakness for not asking for help. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My expectation of the faciliation team, would be that they check in with me once a week and are there to offer help and adivce and avenue for help if they aren't available. Another thing would be for them to keep me on track and keep me to the standard they expect.
