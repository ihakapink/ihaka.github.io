    <p>
     With the following above, I am dedicating 40 solid hours of work, with breaks in between to refresh and break up the days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within these parameters I have set out, I am wanting to be mindful of how much time I spend on one certain section, as the goal is to be able to complete tasks well but at pace. I want to be able to stick to my allocated goals and keep them within time.
    </p>

      For seeking help, my first call will be back to the foundation notes and re-read them, then to the #foundations slack channel to see if anyone else has encountered the problem, then to google and lastly to my facilitator. I think learning how to solve problems on my own is one of my main goals for this course.
