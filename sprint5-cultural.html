             <h3>
        What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
             </h3>
             <p>
        Well, first thing would be I am not as smart as I thought I was just in general, this process has humbled me a lot. Second thing would be I can actually combat the negetive voices in my head with results I can see right in front of me right away. The third thing would be this has kept my ego in check with actually going, "shit I do not know what to do". And that is super frustrating at the time, but in turn it only means, I've found that you can learn from it and take it on board and use it going forward. 

            </p>
          <h3>
            What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
          </h3>
          <p>
            That it actually helped me with my own stuff going on, not just with assitance with coding. Was a bit of a shock. 
          </p>
          <h3>
            What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The first thing we did and introduce ourseleves to the rest of the kohort, and to write semi personal things and share it with compelete strangers was a bit challenging for me.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Because at the end of the day humans aren't computers, and we have emotions and feelings and we need to understand that and be able to interact in a way that we can relate to one another to produce better results. Also for a clear head and mind and a balance to make sure we have a good well being. 
          </p>
          <h3>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
          </h3>
          <p>
            At the start I didn't really think it was useful, but as the sprints got on, even into sprint 2, I did start to understand that it was important for your clear mind and understanding of how humans react and learn new things and actually take all of this information in at once as it is overwhelming to begin with.
